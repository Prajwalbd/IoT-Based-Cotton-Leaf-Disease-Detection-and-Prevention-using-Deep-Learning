# IoT-Based-Cotton-Leaf-Disease-Detection-and-Prevention-using-Deep-Learning
 Cotton leaf disease detection with deep learning involves training CNNs on labeled leaf images to identify  diseases. The model, fine-tuned for accuracy, is deployed in a real-time application to diagnose and  recommend treatments. Continuous improvement is achieved by updating the model with new data.
